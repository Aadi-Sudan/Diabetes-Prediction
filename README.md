# Diabetes-Prediction
Statistical analysis of a collection of models designed to predict type 2 diabetes in patients. Models tested: Neural Net, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, LinearSVC, Decision Tree, K-NN, Gaussian Naive-Bayes. Hyperparameters were optimized using a grid search. Optimal models were analyzed and compared using k-fold cross-validation metrics 

Created for CS 184 (Applied Machine Learning) Final Project.
